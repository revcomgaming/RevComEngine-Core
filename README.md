**Release 1.1 Fixes**

Change Log:

- When any function is called while RPG Maker is initially loading classes, an system failure error occurred. This was caused by trying to get the default dialog window color from the RPG Maker before they were loaded. The correction was to use hard-coded values until they become available after loading.
- When creating multiple windows, a system error would occur. This was caused by updating hash values while they were being accessed by other processes. This was corrected by implementing the existing safe hash updating process as part of window management.
- Ticket "Timer Calling Function That Creates Timer Fails" fixed where using timer within function called by a timer failed.
- Corrected where input box cursor was initially hidden from view.
- Corrected where, after changing the button's fonts, the change would not occur until a mouse event occurred to the button
- Fixed issue where interactive element lists did not align properly.
- When setting input boxes' setting for returning entered text, a system occurred. This was fixed by correcting a syntax error.

Note: There are a number of new features that were part of 2.0 in the release. These are possibility partially implemented or developed. There will not covered in this documentation.
